# W&M 691-03/440-07 - Web Science, Fall 2024 Syllabus

[Jump to Summary Schedule](#summary-schedule) | [Self](https://github.com/anwala/teaching-web-science/blob/main/fall-2024/syllabus.md)

## Course Overview

The Web has fundamentally changed how we learn, play, communicate, and work. Its influence has become so monumental that it has given birth to a new science: Web Science, or the science of decentralized information structures. Although Web Science is interdisciplinary by nature, this course will be focus mainly on the computing aspects of the Web.

**Catalog Description:** Provides an overview of the World Wide Web and associated decentralized information structures, focusing mainly on the computing aspects of the Web: how it works, how it is used, and how it can be analyzed. Students will examine a number of topics including: web architecture, web characterization and analysis, web archiving, Web 2.0, social networks, (creating/detecting) social bots, collective intelligence, search engines, web mining, information diffusion on the web, Semantic Web, etc.

**Prerequisites:** DATA 301 or 310.

* Use the command line to interact with web servers
* Create effective visualizations with moderate proficiency
* [Synthesize and apply critical analysis, solve problems in the Web Science domain, create original material or original scholarship, and communicate effectively with diverse audiences.](https://web.archive.org/web/20231226205314/https://www.wm.edu/as/undergraduate/coll/400/)
* Desire to know more about the web through research!

## Requirements

### Prerequisites

Prerequisites: Student should have taken DATA 301 (or 310) OR approval from the instructor.

We will be using Python this semester. You are not required to know Python ahead of time, but since *you are required to have previous programming experience*, I expect you to be able to pick up the syntax quickly. If you are unfamiliar with Python, I strongly suggest that you spend a bit of time with it before the semester begins.

Here are some good Intro to Python resources:

* [Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)
* [Introduction to Python](http://introtopython.org/)
* [CS 1110: Introduction to Computing Using Python](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2012fa/) (Cornell University)
* [A Gentle Introduction to Programming Using Python](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/lectures/) (MIT)
* [Python Track: Introduction](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/python/index.html) (Cal Tech)
* [Python in One Easy Lesson](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~nick/python-in-one-easy-lesson/), Nick Parlante

## Grading

There will be a total of **110 points** (90 points for assignments, 10 points for final exam, and 10 points points for participation/attendance), and **5 extra** credits points. I'd advise you to do as many extra credits as possible. Consider them as a safety net.

### Assignment Types

I will post all assignments on the [DATA 691-03/440-07 Github repo](https://github.com/anwala/teaching-web-science/tree/main/fall-2024/homework). Each HW directory would contain a `README.md` file with the assignment instructions. Some assignments may also contain data files needed to complete the assignment. Your grade in this class would be based on the following components:

**Homework (HW)** - **90** points + **5** extra-credit points

* Implement concepts from class along with a report
* 9 homework assignments (HW0 -- HW8), each worth 10 points
* Usually due 1.5 -- 2 weeks later
* *Don't wait until the last minute --- these are hard and time-consuming!*
* Grading scale: 0 -- 10
  * 2 points are reserved for the required report
  * Some homework assignments will have extra credit opportunities
* Grading criteria per problem:
  * Completeness (50%)
  * Accuracy (50%)
* All work must be your own. You may use resources (e.g., Stack Overflow) on the Internet for reference. If you use online resources, you must cite your sources (including URL). Group work on HW assignments is not acceptable.

*There is no mid-term*

**Participation/Attendance** - 10 points

Attendance and participation are very important, they increase learning and contribute additional dimensions to discussions. To encourage these, there will be:
* 1 point maximum per week for unannounced in-class quizzes

**Final exam** - 10 points

**Graduate students (DATA 691-03), due: Dec 16, 2024**

Graduate students are not expected to complete the last 4 assignments. Instead, they must implement a research project (40% final grade) involving the application of a web science in their respective research areas. Students must negotiate with me to finalize a research topic (& research questions) by October 13, 2024. 

The research project would involve developing software solutions to address pre-defined research questions, a written report, and a presentation. Students would be graded according to their effectiveness (accuracy/completeness) in,

* Data extraction/cleaning: This could also involve cleanup/transformation of the data, deciding what to collect (sample) and what to exclude (ensure to include in report) and saving the data into a machine-readable format (e.g., JSON, CSV).

* Visualization: This task involves implementing high-quality visualization using D3 or another instructor-approved tool, to effectively communicate ideas and findings.

* Analyses: involves generating statistics to understand the data, address research questions, and identify useful insights.

* Final report/Presentation: A single report that summarizes all effort taken to accomplish tasks is required. Reports must be organized and must include code snippets. Github repositories must includes all code, data, and resources used in project. Python scripts must be well-documented (have comments and ReadMes), implemented in modules (uses separate files/functions), and reusable (no hard-coding). The final presentation must be presented effectively to the class, and slides must include images and code snippets to assist explanations.

### Grading Scale

| Numerical Grade | Letter Grade | | Numerical Grade | Letter Grade |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 93 -- 100 | A   | | 73 -- 76 | C |

## Course History

This course at ODU was originally developed by my PhD supervisor [Dr. Michael Nelson](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/), based on Dr. Frank McCown (ODU alum)'s Intro to Web Science course at Harding University. In previous semesters, it has also been taught by [Dr. Michele C. Weigle](https://cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/) (my 2nd PhD supervisor), and I during my PhD at ODU and Fall 2022/2023 at W&M.

## Course Policies

### Blackboard: NA

### Piazza

Each student must check the class [Piazza (691-03/440-07)](https://piazza.com/class/lza6qojv5yfma/) daily. You should use our class Piazza forum to ask and answer general course-related questions. I will use Piazza to notify you about important updates (assignment deadline changes, office hours cancellations, etc.).

### Participation

Regularly stay involved in class activities. This includes checking Piazza for announcements, submitting assignments on time, and responding to discussion posts in a timely manner.

### Generative AI Use

One of the most important skills you could learn is problem-solving; the ability to go from knowing nothing about a subject, to navigating little or vast amounts of information to address questions, and develop an understanding of the subject. This process is not straightforward, sometimes it involves trial and error through experimentation. It can be frustrating and difficult and requires patience and diligence. But developing good problem-solving skills is rewarding and gives you the ability to become an independent researcher who can be entrusted with solving problems.

I believe using generative AI technology to **think** for you, could suppress your problem-solving skills and rob you of the opportunity to develop the cognitive ability to navigate the unknown. So I don't permit using generative AI as a substitute for your mental process. However, you may use the technology to find information (ensure to verify the accuracy) as long as you note when you use it.

For more details on good and bad use of generative AI, watch [AI can do your homework. Now what?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEJ0_TVXh-I)

### Seeking Help

The course Piazza forum should be your first reference for questions about the class. If you have questions about the course requirements or materials, post your questions on Piazza. For extra help, attend [office hours](https://alexandernwala.com/contact/).

### [Student Accessibility Services](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentaccessibilityservices/)

W&M's Student Accessibility Services offer a variety of services (e.g., [Watson Lab](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentaccessibilityservices/students/services/watsonlab/index.php) and [special needs housing](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentaccessibilityservices/students/services/specialhousing/index.php)) for William & Mary students.

The mission of Student Accessibility Services is to create a barrier-free environment for matriculating students with debilitating diagnosed conditions by considering reasonable accommodations upon request on an individual and flexible basis. 

Student Accessibility Services strives to foster student independence, to encourage self-determination, to emphasize empowerment and accommodation over limitation, and to create a comprehensive, accessible environment to ensure that individuals are viewed on the basis of contribution, not deficit.

## W&M's [Honor Code](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/communityvalues/studenthandbook/honor_system/index.php)

Among the most significant traditions of William & Mary is its student-administered honor system. The essence of the honor system is individual responsibility. We entrust students to maintain the Code and adjudicate matters involving alleged violations of the Code.

The Honor Code is an enduring tradition at the University with documented history that originates as far back as 1736. Today, students administer the Honor pledge to each incoming student and educate faculty and administration on the relevance of the Code and its application to students' lives at the University. Students administer the Code through six Honor Councils and the Council of Chairs.

The Honor Code prohibits lying, cheating, and stealing. For definitions of each offense, view [Section VI: Infractions](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/communityvalues/studenthandbook/honor_system/section_VI/index.php) of the Honor Code.
* **Lying:** the presentation of false information with the intent to deceive.
* **Cheating:** including, but not limited to, the following acts: 
  * Plagiarism
  * Unauthorized Assistance/Collaboration
  * Use of Unauthorized Materials
  * Unauthorized Dual Submission of Previous Academic Work
  * Time Constraint Violation
  * Directions Violation
* **Stealing:** knowingly taking or appropriating the property of another, including property of the university, without the rightful owner’s permission and with the intent to deprive the owner of the property permanently or substantially. One does not receive rightful permission if it is induced by fraud or deception.
