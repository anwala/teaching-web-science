# W&M DATA 440 - Web Science, Fall 2022 Syllabus

[Jump to Summary Schedule](#summary-schedule) | [Download printable PDF version - Coming soon](#)

## Course Overview

The Web has fundamentally changed how we learn, play, communicate, and work. Its influence has become so monumental that it has given birth to a new science: Web Science, or the science of decentralized information structures. Although Web Science is interdisciplinary by nature, this course will be focus mainly on the computing aspects of the Web.

**Catalog Description:** Provides an overview of the World Wide Web and associated decentralized information structures, focusing mainly on the computing aspects of the Web: how it works, how it is used, and how it can be analyzed. Students will examine a number of topics including: web architecture, web characterization and analysis, web archiving, Web 2.0, social networks, (creating/detecting) social bots,  intelligence, search engines, web mining, information diffusion on the web, Semantic Web, etc.

**Prerequisites:** CSCI 140 OR DATA 140 OR CSCI 141 OR DATA 141 OR C141 1.

## Requirements

### Prerequisites

Prerequisites: Student should have taken CSCI 140 OR DATA 140 OR CSCI 141 OR DATA 141 OR C141 1 OR approval from the instructor.

We will be using Python this semester. You are not required to know Python ahead of time, but since *you are required to have previous programming experience*, I expect you to be able to pick up the syntax quickly. If you are unfamiliar with Python, I strongly suggest that you spend a bit of time with it before the semester begins.

Here are some good Intro to Python resources:

* [Introduction to Python](http://introtopython.org/)
* [CS 1110: Introduction to Computing Using Python](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2012fa/) (Cornell University)
* [A Gentle Introduction to Programming Using Python](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/lectures/) (MIT)
* [Python Track: Introduction](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/python/index.html) (Cal Tech)
* [Python in One Easy Lesson](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~nick/python-in-one-easy-lesson/), Nick Parlante

## Grading

There will be a total of 100 points. However, there will be multiple opportunities for extra credits, I'd advise you to do as many extra credits as possible. Consider them as a safety net.

### Assignment Types

Your grade in this class will be based on the following components:

**Online and Class Participation** - 10 points

* Class discussion based on the week's topic or current events.
* More details coming soon.

**Homework (HW)** - 90 points

* Implement concepts from class along with a report
* 9 homework assignments (HW1-HW9), each worth 10 points
* Released on Saturdays and usually due 2 weeks later on Sunday
* *Don't wait until the last minute -- these are hard and time-consuming!*
* Grading scale: 0-10
  * 2 points are reserved for the required report
  * many homework assignments will have extra credit opportunities
* All work must be your own. You may use resources (e.g., Stack Overflow) on the Internet for reference. If you use online resources, you must cite your sources (including URL). Group work on HW assignments is not acceptable.

*There is no mid-term or final exam.*

### Grading Scale

| points | letter | | points | letter |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 100-93 | A | | 76-73 | C |
| 92-90 | A- | | 72-70 | C- |

## Course History

This course at ODU was originally developed by my PhD supervisor [Dr. Michael Nelson](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/), based on Dr. Frank McCown (ODU alum)'s Intro to Web Science course at Harding University. In previous semesters, it has also been taught by [Dr. Michele C. Weigle](https://cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/) (my 2nd PhD supervisor), and myself during my PhD at ODU.

## Course Policies

### Email/Blackboard

Each student must check email and the class **Coming soon** daily. You should use our class **Coming soon** to ask and answer general course-related questions. I will use **Coming soon** to notify you about important updates (assignment deadline changes, office hours cancellations, etc.).

### Participation

Since this is an online class, it is essential that you regularly stay involved in class activities. This includes checking the class Blackboard for announcements, submitting assignments on time, and responding to discussion posts in a timely manner.

### [Student Accessibility Services](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentaccessibilityservices/)

W&M's Student Accessibility Services offer a variety of services (e.g., [Watson Lab](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentaccessibilityservices/students/services/watsonlab/index.php) and [special needs housing](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentaccessibilityservices/students/services/specialhousing/index.php)) for William & Mary students.

The mission of Student Accessibility Services is to create a barrier-free environment for matriculating students with debilitating diagnosed conditions by considering reasonable accommodations upon request on an individual and flexible basis. 

Student Accessibility Services strives to foster student independence, to encourage self-determination, to emphasize empowerment and accommodation over limitation, and to create a comprehensive, accessible environment to ensure that individuals are viewed on the basis of contribution, not deficit.

### Seeking Help

The course **Coming soon** should be your first reference for questions about the class. If you have questions about course requirements or materials, post questions using the class **Coming soon**. For extra help, attend office hours.

## W&M's [Honor Code](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/communityvalues/studenthandbook/honor_system/index.php)

Among the most significant traditions of William & Mary is its student-administered honor system. The essence of the honor system is individual responsibility. We entrust students to maintain the Code and adjudicate matters involving alleged violations of the Code.

The Honor Code is an enduring tradition at the University with documented history that originates as far back as 1736. Today, students administer the Honor pledge to each incoming student and educate faculty and administration on the relevance of the Code and its application to students' lives at the University. Students administer the Code through six Honor Councils and the Council of Chairs.

The Honor Code prohibits lying, cheating, and stealing. For definitions of each offense, view [Section VI: Infractions](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/communityvalues/studenthandbook/honor_system/section_VI/index.php) of the Honor Code.
* **Lying:** the presentation of false information with the intent to deceive.
* **Cheating:** including, but not limited to, the following acts: 
  * Plagiarism
  * Unauthorized Assistance/Collaboration
  * Use of Unauthorized Materials
  * Unauthorized Dual Submission of Previous Academic Work
  * Time Constraint Violation
  * Directions Violation
* **Stealing:** knowingly taking or appropriating the property of another, including property of the university, without the rightful owner’s permission and with the intent to deprive the owner of the property permanently or substantially. One does not receive rightful permission if it is induced by fraud or deception.

## Statement from W&M's Counseling Center

Its primary purpose is to support the mental health and emotional wellness of the community by providing education outreach programming, targeted prevision activities, and intervention services specifically designed for college students. 

The center offers individual, couples and group counseling as appropriate to student needs. We also provide referrals to other resources within the university or the local community that help to support student health and wellness.
